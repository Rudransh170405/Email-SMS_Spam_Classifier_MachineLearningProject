# Email-SMS_Spam_Classifier_MachineLearningProject
In today's digital landscape, email spam has become a pervasive issue, posing risks such as phishing and malware distribution. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning-based email spam classifier. 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning-based email spam classifier capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate (ham) emails.
By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, the goal is to create a scalable and efficient solution that can be deployed in real-world email systems to mitigate the impact of spam.
